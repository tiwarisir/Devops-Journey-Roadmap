🔸 What is DevOps?

DevOps = Development + Operations.
It is a culture, set of practices, and toolchain that bridges the gap between developers and operations teams to deliver software faster, more reliably, and continuously.

DevOps = Development + Operations ka combination.

Matlab software banane wale developers aur usko deploy/manage karne wale operations team ab ek hi side kaam karein.

Yeh sirf tools nahi hai, balki culture + practices + tools ka mix hai.

🔸 Why DevOps?

Traditional IT: Developers write code → Operations deploy it → delays, conflicts, slow releases.

Market needs faster, more reliable delivery.

DevOps addresses this with collaboration, automation, CI/CD, and monitoring.

Benefits:

Faster software delivery

Improved reliability

Continuous feedback & innovation

🔸 Why DevOps? (Problem & Need)

Traditional IT model: Developer bolta → “Mere laptop me toh chal raha hai.” Ops bolta → “Server pe error aa raha hai.” Result = delays + blame game.

Deployment cycles slow (months me naya release).

Market demand fast change chahta tha (Agile world).

🔸 How DevOps Works?

Core Principles:

Automation of builds, tests, and deployments

Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Deployment (CD)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Monitoring & Feedback loops

Cross-team collaboration

Toolchain:

Code: Git, GitHub, GitLab

CI/CD: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI

Containers: Docker

Orchestration: Kubernetes

IaC: Terraform, Ansible

Cloud: AWS, Azure, GCP

Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK

🔸 Future of DevOps

AIOps: AI + ML for predictive monitoring and self-healing systems

GitOps: Infrastructure managed directly from Git repositories

DevSecOps: Embedding security into DevOps pipelines

Platform Engineering: Building internal DevOps platforms for teams

Cloud-native default: DevOps becomes a baseline skill for all IT roles

🔸 How DevOps Works? (Principles + Tools)

Principles:

Automation (manual kaam kam, tools se auto deployment).

Continuous Integration (CI) (code daily integrate/test hota hai).

Continuous Deployment (CD) (new version auto push ho jata hai).

Monitoring & Feedback (infra aur app health 24x7 track).

Collaboration (Dev + Ops ek hi team).
