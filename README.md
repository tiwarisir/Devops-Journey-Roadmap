# Devops-Journey-Roadmap
"The DevOps journey roadmap is a structured step-by-step guide that helps you progress from a beginner to an advanced DevOps professional.It covers the essential foundations like Linux and Git, then moves towards automation, containerization, CI/CD pipelines, cloud, monitoring, and security. The purpose of this roadmap is to give you a clear learning path, avoid confusion, and prepare you for real-world DevOps practices and projects."

**What is IT?**

Information Technology (IT) is the use of hardware, software, networks, and security systems to manage, store, and process data for businesses.

**Evolution of IT:**

1960s â†’ Mainframe computers.

1980s â†’ Personal Computers.

1990s â†’ Internet revolution (emails, websites).

2000s â†’ Cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP).

2010s â†’ SaaS, Mobile apps, AI.

2020s â†’ DevOps, Automation, Cloud-native applications.

**Future of IT:**
AI-driven IT (self-healing systems), edge computing, quantum computing, and IT becoming the core growth driver of businesses.

**What is DevOps?**

DevOps = Development + Operations.
It is a culture, practice, and toolset that integrates developers (who build software) with operations teams (who deploy and manage it).

**Why DevOps emerged:**

Traditional model: developers created code, operations deployed it, leading to delays and conflicts.

Businesses demanded faster, reliable delivery â†’ DevOps solved this through collaboration and automation.

Core Principles: Automation, Collaboration, CI/CD, Monitoring, Feedback loops.
Tools: Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, AWS, Azure.

**Future of DevOps:**

AIOps: AI + automation for proactive infrastructure management.

GitOps: Infrastructure managed as code via Git.

Platform Engineering: In-house DevOps platforms for companies.

Cloud-native world: DevOps becomes a default requirement.
