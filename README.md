**What is IT?**

Information Technology (IT) is the use of hardware, software, networks, and security systems to manage, store, and process data for businesses.

**Evolution of IT:**

1960s → Mainframe computers.

1980s → Personal Computers.

1990s → Internet revolution (emails, websites).

2000s → Cloud computing (AWS, Azure, GCP).

2010s → SaaS, Mobile apps, AI.

2020s → DevOps, Automation, Cloud-native applications.

**Future of IT:**
AI-driven IT (self-healing systems), edge computing, quantum computing, and IT becoming the core growth driver of businesses.

**What is DevOps?**

DevOps = Development + Operations.
It is a culture, practice, and toolset that integrates developers (who build software) with operations teams (who deploy and manage it).

**Why DevOps emerged:**

Traditional model: developers created code, operations deployed it, leading to delays and conflicts.

Businesses demanded faster, reliable delivery → DevOps solved this through collaboration and automation.

Core Principles: Automation, Collaboration, CI/CD, Monitoring, Feedback loops.
Tools: Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, AWS, Azure.

**Future of DevOps:**

AIOps: AI + automation for proactive infrastructure management.

GitOps: Infrastructure managed as code via Git.

Platform Engineering: In-house DevOps platforms for companies.

Cloud-native world: DevOps becomes a default requirement.
